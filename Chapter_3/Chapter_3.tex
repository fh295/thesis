% This chapter is about word representations
\label{CH3}
Can text-based models of word representation be improved in order to achieve human-like performance on evaluations like SimLex-999? It is certainly plausible that models may never acquire human-quality word representations from text, however efficient the learning algorithm and however much data they observe. This is because text data as a learning resource lacks various characteristics of the information available to human learners. For instance, much of conceptual acquisition and word learning, particularly at the early stages, apparently involves the unification of linguistic concepts with those acquired via the perceptual system~\citep{barsalou2005situating}. In addition, as the conceptual system develops, humans actively learn via interactions that depend on the current output of the learner, or explicit explanations targeted at the learner, or following a curriculum. Information in this form is not available to the text-based learning algorithms described in the previous chapter. 

In this and the following chapters, I consider whether the distributed representations acquired by NLMs can be improved via training with more sophisticated prediction tasks, in may cases leveraging training data with more inherent structure than plain raw text. This chapter focuses specifically on word representations, before I extend the scope to phrases and sentences in chapters~\ref{CH4}-ref{CH6}.

In the remainder of this chapeter, I show how enhanced word representations can be acquired from bilingual text data, using recently-developed deep sequence-to-sequence learning architectures trained to translate between pairs of European languages. These architectures constitute the first end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) systems. NMT models have emerged in the past couple of years as an alternative to statistical, phrase-based translation models, and are beginning to achieve impressive translation performance~\citep{kalchbrenner13emnlp,devlin2014fast,Sutskever2014sequence}. 

As I show, NMT models are an effective tool for learning word embeddings with particular semantic properties, as well as a potential new direction for machine translation. Specifically, NMT word embeddings are orientated to reflect semantic similarity (rather than non-specific relatedness or association) and lexical-syntactic role more effectively than embeddings acquired by monolingual NLMs. I demonstrate that these properties persist when translating between different language pairs (English-French and English-German). Further, based on the observation of subtle language-specific effects in the embedding spaces, I conjecture as to why similarity dominates over other semantic relations in translation embedding spaces. Finally, I discuss a potential limitation of the application of NMT models for embedding learning - the computational cost of training large vocabularies of embeddings - and show that a novel method for overcoming this issue preserves the aforementioned properties of translation-based embeddings. 

\section{Encoder-decoder models for Neural Machine Translation}

The objective of NMT models is to generate an appropriate sentence in a target language \(S_t\)  given a sentence \(S_s\) in the source language (see e.g.~\citep{kalchbrenner13emnlp,Sutskever2014sequence}). As a by-product of learning to meet this objective, NMT models learn distinct sets of embeddings for the vocabularies \(V_ s\) and \(V_t\) in the source and target languages respectively.

Observing a training case \((S_s, S_t)\), these models represent \(S_s\) as an ordered sequence of embeddings of words from \(V_s\). The sequence for \(S_s\) is then encoded into a single representation \(R_S\).\footnote{Alternatively, subsequences (phrases) of \(S_s\) may be encoded at this stage in place of the whole sentence~\citep{bahdanau2014neural}.} Finally, by referencing the embeddings in \(V_t\), \(R_S\) and a representation of what has been generated thus far, the model decodes a sentence in the target language word by word. If at any stage the decoded word does not match the corresponding word in the training target \(S_t\), the error is recorded. The weights and embeddings in the model, which together parameterise the encoding and decoding process, are updated based on the accumulated error once the sentence decoding is complete. 

Although NMT models can differ in their low-level architecture~\citep{kalchbrenner13emnlp,Cho2014,bahdanau2014neural}, the translation objective exerts similar pressure on the word embeddings in all cases. The source language embeddings must be such that the model can combine them to form single representations for ordered sequences of multiple words (which in turn must enable the decoding process). The target language embeddings must facilitate the process of decoding these representations into correct target-language sentences.    

\section{Other bilingual models of learning word representations}
Before the advent of effective end-to-end NMT systems, several models had been developed with the specific goal of acquiring distributed word representations from bilingual corpora, aligned at the document, paragraph or word level~\citep{Haghighi2008Learning,vulic2011identifying,mikolov2013exploiting,Hermann:2014:ICLR,lauly2014autoencoder}. While these approaches rely on the same training data as NMT models, one important difference is that they represent the words from two different languages in single common vector space so that words in one language are close to words with similar or related meanings in the other (this is not the case for NMT models, where the source and target language word embeddings inhabit distinct vector spaces). The resulting multilingual embedding spaces have been effectively applied to bilingual lexicon extraction~\citep{Haghighi2008Learning,vulic2011identifying,mikolov2013exploiting} and document classification~\citep{Klementiev,Hermann:2014:ICLR,lauly2014autoencoder,Kocisky:2014}.

For comparison, we focus on two representatives of this class of (non-NMT) bilingual model. The first is that of \cite{Hermann:2014:ICLR}, whose embeddings improve on the performance of~\cite{Klementiev} in document classification applications. As with NMT models, this model can be trained directly on bitexts aligned only at the sentence rather than word level. When training, for aligned sentences \(S_E\) and \(S_F\) in different languages, the model computes representations \(R_E\) and \(R_F\) by summing the embeddings of the words in \(S_E\) and \(S_F\) respectively. The embeddings are then updated to minimise the divergence between \(R_E\) and \(R_F\) (since they convey a common meaning). A noise-contrastive loss function ensures that the model does not arrive at trivial (e.g. all zero) solutions to this objective.~\cite{Hermann:2014:ICLR} show that, despite the lack of prespecified word alignments, words in the two languages with similar meanings converge in the bilingual embedding space.\footnote{The models of \cite{lauly2014autoencoder} and \cite{Hermann:2014:ICLR} both aim to minimise the divergence between source and target language sentences represented as sums of word embeddings. Because of these similarities, I do not compare with both in this paper.}

The second model I examine is that of \cite{faruqui2014improving}. Unlike the models described above, \cite{faruqui2014improving} showed explicitly that projecting word embeddings from two languages (learned independently) into a common vector space can favourably influence the orientation of word embeddings when considered in their monolingual subspace; i.e relative to other words in their own language. In contrast to the other models considered in this paper, the approach of~\cite{faruqui2014improving} requires bilingual data to be aligned at the word level.

\section{Experiments}

To learn translation-based embeddings, I trained two different NMT models. The first is the RNN encoder-decoder, \emph{RNNenc}~\citep{Cho2014}, which uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode all of the source sentence into a single vector on which the decoding process is conditioned. The second is the \emph{RNN Search} architecture~\citep{bahdanau2014neural}, which was designed to overcome limitations exhibited by the RNN encoder-decoder when translating very long sentences. RNN Search includes an \emph{attention} mechanism, an additional feed-forward network that learns to attend to different parts of the source sentence when decoding each word in the target sentence.\footnote{Access to source code and limited GPU time prevented me from training and evaluating the embeddings from other NMT models such as that of~\cite{kalchbrenner13emnlp},~\cite{devlin2014fast} and \cite{Sutskever2014sequence}. The underlying principles of encoding-decoding also apply to these models, and I expect the embeddings would exhibit similar properties to those analysed here.} Both models were trained on a 348m word corpus of English-French sentence pairs or a 91m word corpus of English-German sentence pairs.\footnote{These corpora were produced from the WMT â€™14 parallel data after conducting the data-selection procedure described by~\cite{Cho2014}. } 

To explore the properties of bilingual embeddings learned via objectives other than direct translation, I trained the \emph{BiCVM} model of~\cite{Hermann:2014:ICLR} on the same data, and also downloaded the projected embeddings of~\cite{faruqui2014improving}, \emph{FD}, trained on a bilingual corpus of comparable size (\(\approx 300\) million words per language).\footnote{Available from \url{http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfaruqui/soft.html}. The available embeddings were trained on English-German aligned data, but the authors report similar to for English-French.} Finally, to compare with monolingual word embedding models, I trained a conventional skipgram model~\citep{mikolov2013distributed} and its \emph{Glove} variant~\citep{Pennington2014} for the same number of epochs on the English half of the bilingual corpus. 

To analyse the effect on embedding quality of increasing the quantity of training data, I then trained the monolingual models on increasingly large random subsamples of Wikipedia text (up to a total of 1.1bn words). Lastly, I extracted embeddings from a full-sentence language model, \emph{CW},~\citep{collobert2008unified}, which was trained for several months on the same Wikipedia 1bn word corpus. Note that increasing the volume of training data for the bilingual (and NMT) models was not possible because of the limited size of available sentence-aligned bitexts. 
 
\subsection{Similarity and relatedness} As in previous studies~\citep{Agirre2009,bruni2014multimodal,baroni2014don}, the initial evaluations involved calculating pairwise (cosine) distances between embeddings and correlating these distances with (gold-standard) human judgements of the strength of relationships between concepts. For this I used three different gold standards: WordSim-353~\citep{Agirre2009}, MEN~\citep{bruni2014multimodal} and SimLex-999~\citep{hill2014simlex}. Recall that there is a clear distinction between WordSim-353 and MEN, on the one hand, and SimLex-999, on the other, in terms of the semantic relationship that they quantify. For both WordSim-353 and MEN, annotators were asked to rate how \emph{related} or \emph{associated} two concepts are. Consequently, pairs such as [\emph{clothes}-\emph{closet}], which are clearly related but ontologically dissimilar, have high ratings in WordSim-353 and MEN. In contrast, such pairs receive a low rating in SimLex-999, where only genuinely \emph{similar} concepts, such as [\emph{coast}- \emph{shore}], receive high ratings. 

Table~\ref{table:perf} shows the correlations of NMT (English-French) embeddings, other bilingually trained embeddings and monolingual embeddings with these three lexical gold-standards. NMT outperform monolingual embeddings, and, to a lesser extent, the other bilingually trained embeddings, on SimLex-999. However, this clear advantage is not observed on MEN and WordSim-353, where the projected embeddings of~\cite{faruqui2014improving}, which were tuned for high performance on WordSim-353, perform best. Given the aforementioned differences between the evaluations, this suggests that bilingually-trained embeddings, and NMT based embeddings in particular, better capture similarity, whereas monolingual embedding spaces are orientated more towards relatedness.

\label{table:neigh}
\end{center}
\vspace{-5mm}

\end{table}

To test this hypothesis further, I ran three more evaluations designed to probe the sensitivity of models to similarity as distinct from relatedness or association. In the first, I measured performance on SimLex-Assoc-333 ~\citep{hill2014simlex}. This evaluation comprises the 333 most related pairs in SimLex-999, according to an independent empirical measure of relatedness (free associate generation~\citep{nelson2004university}). Importantly, the pairs in SimLex-Assoc-333, while all strongly related, still span the full range of similarity scores.\footnote{The most dissimilar pair in SimLex-Assoc-333 is [\emph{shrink,grow}] with a score of 0.23. The highest is [\emph{vanish},\emph{disappear}] with 9.80.} Therefore, the extent to which embeddings can model this data reflects their sensitivity to the similarity (or dissimilarity) of two concepts, even in the face of a strong signal in the training data that those concepts are related.    

The TOEFL synonym test is another similarity-focused evaluation of embedding spaces. This test contains 80 cue words, each with four possible answers, of which one is a correct synonym~\citep{landauer1997solution}. I computed the proportion of questions answered correctly by each model, where a model's answer was the nearest (cosine) neighbour to the cue word in its vocabulary.\footnote{To control for different vocabularies, I restricted the effective vocabulary of each model to the intersection of all model vocabularies, and excluded all questions that contained an answer outside of this intersection.} Note that, since TOEFL is a test of synonym recognition, it necessarily requires models to recognise similarity as opposed to relatedness.  

Finally, I tested how well different embeddings enabled a supervised classifier to distinguish between synonyms and antonyms, since synonyms are necessarily similar and people often find antonyms, which are necessarily dissimilar, to be strongly associated. For 744 word pairs hand-selected as either synonyms or antonyms,\footnote{Available online at \url{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fh295/}.} I presented a Gaussian SVM with the concatenation of the two word embeddings. I evaluated accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation. 

As shown in Table~\ref{table:perf}, with these three additional similarity-focused tasks the same pattern of results is observed. NMT embeddings outperform other bilingually-trained embeddings which in turn outperform monolingual models. The difference is particularly striking on SimLex-Assoc-333, which suggests that the ability to discern similarity from relatedness (when relatedness is high) is perhaps the most clear distinction between the bilingual spaces and those of monolingual models. 

These conclusions are also supported by qualitative analysis of the various embedding spaces. As shown in Table~\ref{table:neigh}, in the NMT embedding spaces the nearest neighbours (by cosine distance) to concepts such as \emph{teacher} are genuine synonyms such as \emph{professor} or \emph{instructor}. The bilingual objective also seems to orientate the non-NMT embeddings towards semantic similarity, although some purely related neighbours are also oberved. In contrast, in the monolingual embedding spaces the neighbours of \emph{teacher} include  highly related but dissimilar concepts such as \emph{student} or \emph{college}. 

%\footnote{Readers can inspect nearest neighbours in each embedding space using the web demo.} 
 
\paragraph{Effect of training data quantity}

In previous work, monolingual models were trained on corpora many times larger than the English half of the parallel translation corpus. Indeed, the ability to scale to large quantities of training data was one of the principal motivations behind the skipgram architecture~\citep{mikolov2013distributed}. To check if monolingual models simply need more training data to capture similarity as effectively as bilingual models, I therefore trained them on increasingly large subsets of Wikipedia.\footnote{We did not do the same for the translation models because sentence-aligned bilingual corpora of comparable size do not exist.} As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:size}, this is not in fact the case. The performance of monolingual embeddings on similarity tasks remains well below the level of the NMT embeddings and somewhat lower than the non-MT bilingual embeddings as the amount of training data increases.

\label{fig:size}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Analogy resolution}

Lexical analogy questions have been used as an alternative way of evaluating word representations. In this task, models must identify the correct answer (\emph{girl}) when presented with analogy questions such as `\emph{man} is to \emph{boy} as \emph{woman} is to ?'. It has been shown that Skipgram-style models are surprisingly effective at answering such questions~\citep{mikolov2013distributed}. This is because, if \( \bf m, b \) and \( \bf w\) are skigram-style embeddings for \emph{man}, \emph{boy} and \emph{woman} respectively, the correct answer is often the nearest neighbour in the vocabulary (by cosine distance) to the vector \( \bf v = w + b - m \). 

We evaluated embeddings on analogy questions using the same vector-algebra method as~\cite{mikolov2013distributed}. As in the previous section, for fair comparison I excluded questions containing a word outside the intersection of all model vocabularies, and restricted all answer searches to this reduced vocabulary. This left 11,166 analogies. Of these, 7219 are classed as `syntactic', in that they exemplify mappings between parts-of-speech or syntactic roles (e.g. \emph{fast} is to \emph{fastest} as \emph{heavy} is to \emph{heaviest}), and 3947 are classed as `semantic` (\emph{Ottawa} is to \emph{Canada} as \emph{Paris} is to \emph{France}), since successful answering seems to rely on some (world) knowledge of the concepts themselves. 

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:analogy}, NMT embeddings yield relatively poor answers to semantic analogy questions compared with monolingual embeddings and the bilingual embeddings \emph{FD} (which are projections of similar monolingual embeddings).\footnote{The performance of the FD embeddings on this task is higher than that reported by~\cite{faruqui2014improving} because I search for answers over a smaller total candidate vocabulary.} It appears that the translation objective prevents the embedding space from developing the same linear, geometric regularities as skipgram-style models with respect to semantic organisation. This also seems to be true of the embeddings from the full-sentence language model \emph{CW}. Further, in the case of the Glove and FD models this advantage seems to be independent of both the domain and size of the training data, since embeddings from these models trained on only the English half of the translation corpus still outperform the translation embeddings. 

On the other hand, NMT embeddings are effective for answering syntactic analogies using the vector algebra method. They perform comparably to or even better than monolingual embeddings when trained on less data (albeit bilingual data). It is perhaps unsurprising that the translation objective incentivises the encoding of a high degree of lexical syntactic information, since coherent target-language sentences could not be generated without knowledge of the parts-of-speech, tense or case of its vocabulary items. The connection between the translation objective and the embedding of lexical syntactic information is further supported by the fact that embeddings learned by the bilingual model BiCVM do not perform comparably on the syntactic analogy task. In this model, sentential semantics is transferred via a bag-of-words representation, presumably rendering the precise syntactic information less important.

When considering the two properties of NMT embeddings highlighted by these experiments, namely the encoding of semantic similarity and lexical syntax, it is worth noting that items in the similarity-focused evaluations of the previous section (SimLex-999 and TOEFL) consist of word groups or pairs that have identical syntactic role. Thus, even though lexical semantic information is in general pertinent to conceptual similarity~\citep{levy2014dependency}, the lexical syntactic and conceptual properties of translation embeddings are in some sense independent of one another.

\section{Effect of Target Language}
\label{lang_effects}

To better understand why a translation objective yields embedding spaces with particular properties, I trained the RNN Search architecture to translate from English to German.

\label{table:de}
\end{center}
\vspace{-5mm}
\end{table}

As shown in Table~\ref{table:de} (left side), the performance of the source (English) embeddings learned by this model was comparable to that of those learned by the English-to-French model on all evaluations, even though the English-German training corpus (91 million words) was notably smaller than the English-French corpus (348m words). This evidence shows that the desirable properties of translation embeddings highlighted thus far are not particular to English-French translation, and can also emerge when translating to a different language family, with different word ordering conventions.     

\section{Overcoming the vocabulary size problem}

A potential drawback to using NMT models for learning word embeddings is the computational cost of training such a model on large vocabularies. To generate a target language sentence, NMT models repeatedly compute a softmax distribution over the target vocabulary. This computation scales with vocabulary size and must be repeated for each word in the output sentence, so that training models with large output vocabularies is challenging. Moreover, while the same computational bottleneck does not apply to the encoding process or source vocabulary, there is no way in which a translation model could learn a high quality source embedding for a word if the plausible translations were outside its vocabulary. Thus, limitations on the size of the target vocabulary effectively limit the scope of NMT models as representation-learning tools. This contrasts with the shallower monolingual and bilingual representation-learning models considered in this paper,  which efficiently compute a distribution over a large target vocabulary using either a hierarchical softmax~\citep{morin2005hierarchical} or approximate methods such as negative sampling~\citep{mikolov2013distributed,Hermann:2014:ICLR}, and thus can learn large vocabularies of both source and target embeddings.

A recently proposed solution to this problem enables NMT models to be trained with larger target vocabularies (and hence larger meaningful source vocabularies) at comparable computational cost to training with a small target vocabulary~\citep{Jean}. The algorithm uses (biased) importance sampling~\citep{Bengio+Senecal-2003-small} to approximate the probability distribution of words over a large target vocabulary with a finite set of distributions over subsets of that vocabulary. Despite this element of approximation in the decoder, extending the effective target vocabulary in this way significantly improves translation performance, since the model can make sense of more sentences in the training data and encounters fewer unknown words at test time. In terms of representation learning, the method provides a means to scale up the NMT approach to vocabularies as large as those learned by monolingual models. However, given that the method replaces an exact calculation with an approximate one, I tested how the quality of source embeddings is affected by scaling up the target language vocabulary in this way.

As shown in Table~\ref{table:ex}, there is no significant degradation of embedding quality when scaling to large vocabularies with using the approximate decoder. Note that for a fair comparison I filtered these evaluations to only include items that are present in the smaller vocabulary. Thus, the numbers do not directly reflect the quality of the additional 470k embeddings learned by the extended vocabulary models, which one would expect to be lower since they are words of lower frequency. All embeddings can be downloaded from \url{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fh295/}, and the embeddings from the smaller vocabulary models can be interrogated at \url{http://lisa.iro.umontreal.ca/mt-demo/embs/}.\footnote{A different solution to the rare-word problem was proposed by~\cite{luong2014addressing}. I do not evaluate the effects on the resulting embeddings of this method because I lack access to the source code.} 


\section{Discussion}
\label{section:exp}

Although NMT models appear to encode both conceptual similarity and syntactic information for any source and target languages, it is not the case that embedding spaces will always be identical. Interrogating the nearest neighbours of the source embedding spaces of the English-French and English-German models reveals occasional language-specific effects. As shown in Table~\ref{table:de} (right side), the neighbours for the word \emph{earned} in the English-German model are as one might expect, whereas the neighbours from the English-French model contain the somewhat unlikely candidate \emph{won}. In a similar vein, while the neighbours of the word \emph{castle} from the English-French model are unarguably similar, the neighbours from the English-German model contain the word \emph{padlock}.
 
These infrequent but striking differences between the English-German and English-French source embedding spaces indicate how similarity might emerge effectively in NMT models. Tokens of the French verb \emph{gagner} have (at least) two possible English translations (\emph{win} and \emph{earn}). Since the translation model, which has limited encoding capacity, is trained to map tokens of \emph{win} and \emph{earn} to the same place in the target embedding space, it is efficient to move these concepts closer in the source space. Since \emph{win} and \emph{earn} map directly to two different verbs in German, this effect is not observed. On the other hand, the English nouns \emph{castle} and \emph{padlock} translate to a single noun (\emph{Schloss}) in German, but different nouns in French. Thus, \emph{padlock} and \emph{castle} are only close in the source embeddings from the English-German model. 

Based on these considerations, I can conjecture that the following condition on the semantic configuration between two language is crucial to the effective induction of lexical similarity. 

\MyQuote{\emph{For \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) in the source language, there is some \(t\) in the targThe horse raced past the barn fellet language such that there are sentences in the training data in which \(s_1\) translates to \(t\) and sentences in which \(s_2\) translates to \(t\).}}

{\centering \emph{if and only if} \\}

\MyQuote{\emph{\(s_1\) and \(s_2\) are semantically similar.}}

Of course, this condition is not true in general. However, I propose that the extent to which it holds over all possible word pairs corresponds to the quality of similarity induction in the translation embedding space. Note that strong polysemy in the target language, such as \emph{gagner = win, earn}, can lead to cases in which \(1\) is satisfied but \(2\) is not. The conjecture claims that these cases are detrimental to the quality of the embedding space (at least with regards to similarity). In practice, qualitative analyses of the embedding spaces and native speaker intuitions suggest that such cases are comparatively rare. Moreover, when such cases are observed, \(s_1\) and \(s_2\), while perhaps not similar, are not strongly dissimilar. This could explain why related but strongly dissimilar concepts such as antonym pairs do not converge in the translation embedding space. This is also consistent with qualitative evidence presented by~\cite{faruqui2014improving} that projecting monolingual embeddings into a bilingual space orientates them to better reflect the synonymy/antonymy distinction.
    

\section{Conclusions}

The analysis in this chapter makes it clear that not all distributed word representations learned by neural language models are alike. I have shown that the embedding spaces from neural machine translation models are orientated more towards conceptual similarity than those of monolingual models, and that translation embedding spaces also reflect richer lexical syntactic information. To perform well on similarity evaluations such as SimLex-999, embeddings must distinguish information pertinent to what concepts \emph{are} (their function or ontology) from information reflecting other non-specific inter-concept relationships. Concepts that are strongly related but dissimilar, such as antonyms, are particularly challenging in this regard~\citep{hill2014simlex}. The semantic correspondence between the words in languages enables NMT embeddings to distinguish synonyms and antonyms, and also facilitates better performance on syntactic analogical reasoning. Just as being exposed to multiple languages can be an advantage for both the cognitive and cultural development of humans, training NLMs on bilingual texts can allow them to acquire a perspective on lexical semantics that may not otherwise emerge.

The language-specific effects I observed in Section~\ref{lang_effects} suggest a potential avenue for improving translation and multi-lingual embeddings in future work. As observed by both~\cite{Hermann:2014:ICLR} and~\cite{faruqui2014improving}, the bilingual representation learning paradigm can be naturally extended to update representations based on correspondences between multiple languages (for instance by interleaving English-French and English-German training examples). Such an approach should smooth out language-specific effects, leaving embeddings that encode only language-agnostic conceptual semantics and are thus more generally applicable. Another related challenge is to develop smaller or less complex representation-learning tools that encode similarity with as much fidelity as NMT models but without the computational overhead. One promising approach for this is to learn word alignments and word embeddings jointly~\citep{Kocisky:2014}. 

Together with a growing body of work, this chapter demonstrates that a focus on word representation can provide an instructive constrained environment for understanding how conceptual knowledge is encoded in distributed memories. Nevertheless, the majority of linguistic meaning is communicated not by individual words, but in the form of statements, utterances, propositions or observations that consist of multiple words, phrases or sentences. When interpreting such phrases, the interpretation of words always takes place in some wider context [REF], and it is based on such context-dependent interpretations that the utterance is understood. For technology to be capable of general language understanding, systems will undoubtedly require ways to interpret and represent the phrases and sentences as well as words. To this end, in the next chapter I develop a framework and various approaches for training neural language models to interpret phrases, which are then extended to full sentences in Chapter~\ref{CH5}.
